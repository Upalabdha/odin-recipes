    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Chilli Chicken is a popular Indo-Chinese dish made by marinating chicken pieces in soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and cornstarch, then deep-frying them until crispy. The fried chicken is then tossed in a spicy, tangy sauce made with green chilies, garlic, onions, capsicum, soy sauce, vinegar, and a hint of sugar. It’s typically garnished with spring onions and served hot as a starter or with fried rice or noodles.</p>
